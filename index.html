				<div class="paraContent">
					<p>I'm Connor, raised as one of four. My interests in IT came at a young age when I was interested in all the technology, I could get my hands on at the time. Slowly my passion became more honed, I got my first computer and quickly became the families go to IT fixer. I studied more and more until starting my Cisco Course for Highschool. I learnt various trouble shooting methods, picked a couple new tricks surrounding hardware, routing and switching networks. Learning more and more at the course just fired up my passion to learn more. It eventually led me to want to learn and develop my skills even further.

				<h1>Interests in IT</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="paraContent">

				<p>My interest in IT is a wide array, from studying networks in high school, to messing around with tech outside of class, every part of the industry fascinates me. My interest in IT began when I was young, as my father has a background in IT software, which exposed me to newer and newer technologies as time went on, that spurred me on to seek out more knowledge by myself.</p>
				<br>
				<p>I chose to come to RMIT as I was in a position where I felt trapped by my career path, I was eventually led seeking out knowledge to build upon my already acquired. While in the course I hope to learn more make me a well-rounded IT Enthusiast.</p>
				<p>During my studies, I hope to learn more about different coding languages, which is a skill I am lacking in. I want to broaden my understanding of the fundamentals, not only in networking, but the inner workings of the IT Industry.</p>

			<h1>Ideal Job</h1>
		</div>

		<div class="paraContent">
			<article>
				<h3>Network Engineer</h3>
				<img src="jobDescription.jpg" alt="Job Description" />
				<p>A network Engineer would be responsible for managing
the network, having a background in networking, routing
and security. The job is appealing to me as it utilises
previously known skills and places me in an environment
that would enable me to constantly develop my skills.
</p>
				<h3>Skills I have.</h3>
				<p>I have certification in routing and switching (CCNP), knowledge of switching protocols including VLANs, Spanning Tree, understanding QoS on routers and switches and firewalls, and in depth understanding and experience using OSPF and BGP</p>
				<h3>Skills I need.</h3>
				<p>To start with a plan on working towards the qualifications I need for the job, I would need to gain more experience with switching protocols used in an Enterprise setting, gaining a professional certification for CCNP, hopefully an internship once I have the qualifications necessary.

				<h2> Myers Briggs Type Indicator</h2>

				<p class="subInfo"</p>
				<h3>Strengths</h3>
				<p>a.	The outcome of these results is scarily true, the more I read the more I aligned with everything it was saying, being from work habits, work and life flow balance, friendship.	</p>
				<h3>Weaknesses</h3>
				<p>I think this would benefit, working as a small group, as I tend to thrive in that area, I’m wanting everyone to do well in the group
				</p>
				<h3>Team Composition</h3>
				<p>I think this would benefit, working as a small group, as I tend to thrive in that area, I’m wanting everyone to do well in the group, but also learn and grow more, as I’m more than happy to help anyone even if I’m not sure what the answer is myself	</p>

				<h2>Learning Styles</h2>
				<img src="learningStyles.jpg" alt="Learning Styles Test" />
				<p class="subInfo">Learning Styles</p>
				<h4>Strengths</h4>
				<p>	I really do like to stand back observe and see how everything is done, then reflect on what I have seen and make my own decisions and conclusions, sometimes a considerable amount of time and effort are required to develop these ideas.
				</p>
				<h4>Weaknesses</h4>
				<p>	I think the results from this test show that I would be good with discussions, showcase/demonstrations, feedback from others and coaching.
				</p>
				<h4>Team Composition</h4>
				<p>Having a group discussion to find out what people have sound knowledge and fill in the gaps, I would not push someone away if they came to me looking for help.

				<h2>Big 5 Traits</h2>
				<img src="bigFive.jpg" alt="Big 5 Traits Test" />
				<p class="subInfo">big5Traits</p>
				<h4>Strengths</h4>
				<p>The results for this test show that I’m clearly an introvert, that doesn’t have great emotional stability, am generally agreeable, but at the same time conscientious of my actions, but also approaching the situation with intellect and imagination. 	</p>
				<h4>Weaknesses</h4>
				<p>It might be a little hard for me to keep communication with people,as my introversion and emotional instablity might not agree sometimes, thus making me hard to contact.</p>
				<h4>Team Composition</h4>
				<p>Try to not let my emotions get in the way too much when it comes to uni work. Take breaks every so often to not let everything get too over whelming. Let the other members know that I am prone to sudden drops in mood.</p>

			<h1>Project Idea.</h1>
		</div>

		<div class="paraContent">
			<article>
				<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>The Project will be mainly based on Cat based enjoyment, I don’t have anything concrete, but some sort of toy that can be put through stress to achieve a longer life span than normal cat toys. By using a Raspberry Pi to achieve a toy to help prevent loneliness in cats.	</p>
			</article>

			<article>
				<h2>Motivation</h2>
				<p>The motivation for this project comes right from home, as I have a Ragdoll cat. They are very dog like creatures, so they do tend to show more affection than most cats. I have been told by friends that he’s very loud and annoying if there isn’t any one to hang around so I thought, how could I think up something unique that might cheer the little guy up when I’m gone.	</p>
			</article>

			<article>
				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>Either a ball type design with the raspberry Pi inside, connected to the raspberry Pi would be a motion sensor, a weighted motor set up to move different depending on the motion sensed by the sensor. Potentially I would like to add some sort of Bluetooth device or something to add more to a collar like device to enable more functionality between the cat and the toy, if possible. If a ball design is not possible I would like to move to something more stationary, a box like design where a ball goes in the top, goes down a path till it reaches the bottom, while allowing enough time for the ball to reach the end. Connected to the chamber where the ball is seated the ball is launched with a small burst of air made with a quiet hair dryer, or something of the sort. Also, when the ball is first placed in the contraption a small treat is dispensed on the device, as to promote learning for the pet and reward him, while he learns to operate the device by himself. The services that this would provide for the cat, while I would be away at work, as cat’s need at least 15 minutes of continuous attention.
				</p>
			</article>

			<article>
				<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
				<p>I would be using a Raspberry Pi to control the brain of the device. Connected to the raspberry pi would be a motion senser to detect whether the ball has been placed in the tube, part of an automatic feed device, as to not give out too many treats at once, at the bottom of the feed bowl is a pressure sensor that will fire the ball once pressure has been applied and released. I would be coding the raspberry pi to watch with the motion senser, releasing treats once activated then then waits for the sensor on the bowl to activate to use the motor device to shoot the ball for the cat to fetch and return to the box device.	</p>
			</article>

			<article>
				<h2>Skills Required</h2>
				<p>I would need to learn how I how to connect everything to the Raspberry Pi and power it all with a small battery, while fitting the contraption in a box that is not to big to be an obstruction but provides enough space for air to escape. I would need to learn how to code for the Raspberry Pi. I will probably encounter problems figuring out how everything would work seamlessly in the way that I have envisioned	</p>
			</article>

			<article>
				<h2>Outcome</h2>
				<p>The outcome of the project would be a trying to achieve a device that an animal can interact with and it will over time train the pet to use the toy for itself. The outcome would be cat owners would be able to buy this and entertain their cat, if they were out shopping, working a full time job, or just generally too busy to give their cat the attention it needs	</p>
